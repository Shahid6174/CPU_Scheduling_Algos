# Implementing CPU Scheduling Algorithms using C

This repository focuses on implementing major CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), 
Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.

Each program takes input parameters such as the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and priority (for priority scheduling) and applies the respective scheduling algorithm to schedule these processes.

The implementation is structured by treating each process as a unit and creating a custom data type for it using structures. 
This approach allows for a clear representation of process attributes and facilitates the implementation of different scheduling algorithms.
